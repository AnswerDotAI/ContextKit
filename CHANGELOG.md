## 0.0.8

### New Features

- pypdf2 has moved to pypdf ([#7](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/ContextKit/pull/7)), thanks to [@RensDimmendaal](https://github.com/RensDimmendaal)
  - This PR renames dependency `PyPDF2` to `pypdf` as the maintainers moved that package.
This move will silence the deprecation warning that's currently shown when using contextkit.

> .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/PyPDF2/__init__.py:21: DeprecationWarning: PyPDF2 is deprecated. Please move to the pypdf library instead.
