The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it \\nmay have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under \\nthis Agreement, unless , and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly \\nauthorized officer of the Company.

The Company and Consultant have \\nattempted to limit Consultant’s right to use, maintain and disclose the Company’s Confidential \\nInformation, and to limit Consultant’s right to solicit e mployees and customers only to the extent \\nnecessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.

In the event that \\nany court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the \\nterms of the Consulting Agreement specifying Consultant’s R elationship with the Company as \\nthat of an independent contractor, Consultant’s provision of services to the Company is not as an \\nindependent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the \\nextent that such determination  is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship \\nbetween Consultant and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment \\nrelationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the \\nfullest exten t as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent \\nand purpose of the Agreement.  \\n(f) Remedies .  Consultant acknowledges and agrees that violation of this \\nAgreement by Consultant may cause the Company irreparable harm, and ther efore Consultant \\nagrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not \\nlimited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions \\nwithout the necessity of posting a bond or other  security (or, where such a bond or security is \\nrequired, Consultant agrees that a $1,000 bond will be adequate),  in addition to and without \\nprejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this \\nAgreement.  \\n(g) Advice of Couns el.  CONSULTANT ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT, IN \\nEXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, CONSULTANT HAS  HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO \\nSEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND CONSULTANT HAS \\nREAD AND UNDERSTANDS  ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS \\nAGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT S HALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY \\nPARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.  \\n(h) Counterparts .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of \\ncounterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all \\nof which  together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   Execution of a facsimile copy \\nwill have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile signature will be \\ndeemed an original and valid signature.  \\n[Signature Page Follows]    \\n-9- The parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be \\neffective as of the Effective Date first above written.  \\n \\nTHE COMPANY:  \\n \\nPARETO INC. \\nE-signed using Clerky (158ef46d9f3a8e332a13612889ff329f)  \\nBy: Xuechun Yao   \\nXuechun Yao, CEO & Founder  \\n8145 Halifax Drive  \\nClayton, MO 63105  \\nphoebe@hellopareto.com  \\nDate:  May 05, 2021  \\n \\n \\n \\nCONSULTANT : \\n \\nJAMES MACHARIA  \\nE-signed using Clerky (a01631d2b35214a7b6f9f6431d6d913f)  \\nJames Macharia   \\njamesmasher13@gmail.com  \\nDate:  May 05, 2021  \\n   \\n  EXHIBIT  A \\nLIST OF PRIOR INVENTIONS  \\nAND ORIGINAL WORKS OF AUTHORSHIP  \\nEXCLUDED UNDER SECTION  4(a)  \\nThe following is a list of all Inventions that, as of the Effective Date:  (A) Consultant \\nmade, and/or (B) belong solely to Consultant or belong to Consultant jointly with others \\nor in which  Consultant has an interest, and that relate in any way to any of the \\nCompany’s actual or proposed businesses, products, services, or research and \\ndevelopment, and which are not assigned to the Company:  \\n \\nPrior Inventions : \\nNone  \\n \\n[Signature Page Follows]    \\n-2-  \\nExcept as indicated above on this Exhibit A , Consultant has no inventions, improvements \\nor original works to disclose pursuant to Section  4(a) of this Agreement.  \\n \\nConsultant:  \\n \\nJAMES MACHARIA  \\nE-signed using Clerky (a01631d2b35214a7b6f9f6431d6d913f)  \\nJames Macharia   \\njamesmasher13@gmail.com  \\nDate:  May 05, 2021  \\n   \\n  EXHIBIT  B \\nSection 2870 of the California Labor Code is as follows:  \\n(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an \\nemployee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or \\nher employer shall not apply to an invention that the  employee developed entirely on his \\nor her own time without using the employer ’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade \\nsecret information except for those inventions that either:  \\n(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the \\ninvention to the employer ’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or \\ndevelopment of the employer; or  \\n(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the \\nemployer.  \\n(b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports t o require \\nan employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required t o be \\nassigned under subdivision  (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and \\nis unenforceable.  \\nChapter 765, Section 1060/2 of the Illinois Compiled St atutes is as follows:  \\n(1) A provision in an employment agreement which provides that an \\nemployee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee ’s rights in an invention to \\nthe employer does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, f acilities, \\nor trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely \\non the employee’s own time, unless (a)  the invention relates (i)  to the bu siness of the \\nemployer, or (ii)  to the employer ’s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or \\ndevelopment, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for \\nthe employer.
